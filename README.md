# Todo List
Todo List Project
This is my first simple project aimed at learning how front-end and back-end systems interact through APIs. The application is a todo list built using React and CSS for the front end, and FastAPI for the back end.

Features
Add Tasks – Input and save your tasks

Edit or Delete Tasks – Modify or remove tasks as needed

Mark as Complete – Click on a task to mark it as done (a strikethrough will appear)

Auto Deletion – Completed tasks are automatically deleted 24 hours after being marked as done.
